-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Search for gratings

call "CalcGrat.m" function 

% Example: CalcGrat(2.800, 2.850, 3, 1, 3)
% Example: CalcGrat(2.700, 2.850, 9, 4, 6)

Note: boundaries of parameters in this function should be defined
para.axmax=28;  % large number is required for 6 Numdir, eg. 40
para.aymax=28;  % large number is required for 6 Numdir, eg. 40
para.bxmax=28;  % large number is required for 6 Numdir, eg. 40
para.bxmin=2;
para.bymax=28;  % large number is required for 6 Numdir, eg. 40
para.bymin=2;


2. After some grating parameters are found, generate binary grating images with those parameters and check the phase of each grating image.

call "FourDimGrating2png_HW.m" function 

Example: FourDimGrating2png_HW([5 17 25;-26 -19 -9;2 19 33;4 -17 -9],3,3,1,'o3p3_LSIM')
